Simple(?) shell script to automate some of the ways one might create a new git repo.
The initial intent was to automate creating remote repos to push to for backup/sharing purposes.  Has been expanding to slightly more varied uses as well.

## Supports:
* creating a new project from scratch with no code yet (" -n <newprojectname> ")
* already being somewhere and initializing from all current code (" -i ")
* creating a remote repo on your own server
* creating a remote repo on github
